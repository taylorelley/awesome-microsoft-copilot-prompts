# Copilot for Security — SOC Operations

> 20 SCU-optimized prompts for SOC analysts. Each prompt specifies the data source, scope, and output format to minimize follow-up interactions and SCU consumption.

**REQUIRES:** Microsoft Copilot for Security (standalone portal or embedded experience). These prompts do NOT work in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. Copilot for Security requires separate provisioning — see the [README](./README.md) for SCU and licensing details.

**Category:** Security Operations

**Prompts:** 20

---

## SCU NOTE — Read Before Using

Each prompt below follows the 4-element structure (goal + data source + scope + output format). Using prompts as written keeps SCU consumption to 1–2 per interaction. Modifying them to be more open-ended (removing the data source, removing the output format) will increase SCU consumption.

## Incident Triage

### 1. First Look — Incident Summary

Use when a new high-severity incident lands and you need a fast, structured overview before diving in.

**Target Personas:** SOC Analyst L1/L2, Incident Responder

**Tags:** `incident`, `triage`, `defender-xdr`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
Summarize incident [INCIDENT ID] in Microsoft Defender XDR. Include:
1. What happened (one paragraph, plain language)
2. Affected entities: list all users and devices involved
3. Attack timeline: key events in chronological order
4. Current status: contained, active, or unknown
5. Recommended immediate actions

Format as a structured incident brief. Flag any entity that appears across more than one alert in this incident.
```

---

### 2. Alert Triage — Is This a True Positive?

Use to quickly assess whether an alert warrants escalation before spending time on full investigation.

**Target Personas:** SOC Analyst L1, Tier 1 Triage

**Tags:** `alert`, `triage`, `defender-xdr`, `false-positive`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Defender XDR, analyze alert [ALERT ID]. 

Answer these questions:
1. What activity triggered this alert?
2. Has this alert type fired for this user or device before in the last 30 days? If yes, how many times and what was the resolution?
3. Is the triggering activity consistent with the user's normal behaviour based on available context?
4. What is your assessment: likely true positive, likely false positive, or requires investigation? State your reasoning in one paragraph.

Do not recommend remediation actions — assessment only.
```

---

### 3. Multi-Alert Correlation — Single Incident Thread

Use when multiple alerts across different products appear related and you need to determine if they form a single attack chain.

**Target Personas:** SOC Analyst L2/L3, Threat Hunter

**Tags:** `correlation`, `defender-xdr`, `sentinel`, `attack-chain`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
I have the following alert IDs that may be related: [LIST ALERT IDs].

In Microsoft Defender XDR, examine these alerts and determine:
1. Do these alerts share common entities (users, devices, IPs, file hashes)? List the shared entities.
2. Is there a logical sequence — do any alerts appear to be precursors or consequences of others?
3. Should these be merged into a single incident? State yes or no with one-paragraph reasoning.

Return a table of alerts with columns: Alert ID, Timestamp, Entity, Tactic (MITRE), and your correlation assessment.
```

---

### 4. Device Investigation — Rapid Scope

Use to quickly establish what a device has been doing around the time of an alert before deciding whether to isolate.

**Target Personas:** SOC Analyst L2, Incident Responder

**Tags:** `device`, `defender-xdr`, `endpoint`, `investigation`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Defender XDR, investigate device [DEVICE NAME or ID].

For the period [START TIME] to [END TIME]:
1. List all processes executed — flag any that are unusual, unsigned, or living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins)
2. List all network connections — flag any to external IPs or uncommon destinations
3. List all file events — flag any new executables dropped or scripts run
4. Was any lateral movement attempted from this device?

Return findings as a structured table per category. Flag items that require immediate action.
```

---

### 5. User Investigation — Credential Compromise Assessment

Use when a user account shows anomalous behaviour or is referenced in an alert.

**Target Personas:** SOC Analyst L2, Identity Security Analyst

**Tags:** `identity`, `entra`, `credential-compromise`, `sign-in`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Entra ID, investigate user [UPN or display name].

For the last 72 hours:

2. Flag any sign-ins from new locations, new devices, or impossible travel scenarios
3. Were any MFA prompts denied or bypassed?
4. Were any privileged roles assigned or modified on this account in this period?

Return a table of sign-in events sorted by timestamp. Highlight high-risk events in bold.
```

---

### 6. Email Threat Analysis

In Microsoft Defender XDR (email & collaboration), investigate the email with [message ID / subject / sender] received by [recipient UPN] on [date].

Provide:
1. Sender details: display name, actual sending address, sending IP, and reputation
2. URL analysis: list all URLs in the email and their verdict (safe, suspicious, malicious, unknown)
3. Attachment analysis: list attachments, file type, hash, and verdict if available
4. Delivery action taken by Defender: what happened to the email?
5. Was this email sent to other recipients in the organisation? If yes, how many?

Conclude with a one-paragraph verdict: phishing, malware delivery, business email compromise, spam, or benign.

2. Top 3 incidents by severity: for each, one-sentence summary and current status
3. Alerts closed as false positive in the last 24 hours: count
4. Any active threat hunts or ongoing investigations: status update
5. Vulnerabilities newly discovered in the last 24 hours with a CVSS score above 7.0

Format as a briefing note. Keep total length under 300 words. This will be shared with the security leadership team.

**Prompt:**

```
I need to brief [AUDIENCE — e.g. "the CFO and COO" or "the board risk committee"] on the following security event or posture update: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION].

Here are the technical details: [PASTE TECHNICAL SUMMARY].

Rewrite this as a non-technical briefing that:
1. Explains what happened or what the risk is in plain language (no jargon)
2. States the business impact clearly — what could happen if this isn't addressed?
3. Describes what has been done or is being done
4. States what decision or approval, if any, is needed from this audience

Keep it under 200 words. Do not soften the risk — be accurate about the potential impact.
```

---

### 20. KQL Query Generation — Save for Reuse

Use to generate a KQL query you can save, test, and reuse — avoiding repeated Copilot prompting for the same hunt.

**Target Personas:** Threat Hunter, SOC Analyst L3, Detection Engineer

**Tags:** `kql`, `sentinel`, `defender-xdr`, `query-generation`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
Write a KQL query for Microsoft Sentinel (or Defender XDR advanced hunting — specify which) that detects the following behaviour: [DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOUR IN PLAIN LANGUAGE].

Requirements:
- The query should cover a configurable time window (use a variable at the top for easy adjustment)
- Include comments explaining each major section
- Return results as a table with columns: timestamp, entity (user or device), action, source, and severity if applicable
- Include a count of events per entity so I can identify which entities are generating the most hits

After the query, add a one-paragraph explanation of the detection logic and any known false positive scenarios I should filter out.
```
