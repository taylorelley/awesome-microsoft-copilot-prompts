# Copilot for Security — Security Reporting & Management

> 15 SCU-optimized prompts for security managers, CISOs, and compliance leads. Focused on translating security data into decisions: vulnerability reports, compliance posture, board briefings, and audit responses.

**REQUIRES:** Microsoft Copilot for Security (standalone portal or embedded experience). See the [README](./README.md) for SCU and licensing details.

**Category:** Security Management & Reporting

**Prompts:** 15

---

## SCU NOTE

These prompts are structured for single-interaction execution. Each includes a data source, scope, and output format. Use them as written to keep SCU consumption low. Open-ended variants ("summarize my security posture") will burn significantly more SCUs with less useful output.

## Vulnerability Reporting

### 1. Monthly Vulnerability Summary for Leadership

Use at the end of each month to produce a consistent vulnerability posture report without manually pulling data.

**Target Personas:** Security Manager, CISO, Vulnerability Management Lead

**Tags:** `vulnerability`, `reporting`, `defender-xdr`, `leadership`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Defender XDR (Threat & Vulnerability Management), produce a monthly vulnerability summary for [MONTH/YEAR].

Include:
1. Total open vulnerabilities at end of month: breakdown by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. Vulnerabilities remediated this month: count and percentage of total open
3. New vulnerabilities discovered this month: count
4. Top 5 vulnerabilities by number of affected devices (include CVE ID, description, device count, and patch availability)
5. Mean time to remediate (MTTR) for critical vulnerabilities this month, if available
6. Devices with the highest number of unpatched critical vulnerabilities: top 5

Format as a one-page management report. Use plain language for the summary section — this will be reviewed by non-technical stakeholders.
```

### 2. Patch Compliance Report by Business Unit

Use to track patch compliance across organisational units and identify which teams are creating risk.

**Target Personas:** Security Manager, IT Director, Compliance Lead

**Tags:** `vulnerability`, `patch-compliance`, `defender-xdr`, `reporting`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Defender XDR (Threat & Vulnerability Management), generate a patch compliance report.

For devices grouped by [DEPARTMENT / LOCATION / DEVICE GROUP — specify which dimension is configured in your environment]:
1. Count of devices per group
2. Percentage of devices fully patched (no critical or high vulnerabilities)
3. Percentage with at least one unpatched critical vulnerability
4. The single highest-severity unpatched CVE in each group

Return as a table sorted by patch compliance percentage ascending (worst first). Flag any group below 70% patch compliance.
```

### 3. Zero-Day and Active Exploit Exposure Check

Use immediately when a new zero-day or actively exploited CVE is announced.

**Target Personas:** CISO, Security Manager, SOC Lead

**Tags:** `zero-day`, `cve`, `active-exploit`, `defender-xdr`, `executive`, `scu-efficient`

**Prompt:**

```
In Microsoft Defender XDR (Threat & Vulnerability Management), check our environment's exposure to [CVE ID].

Provide:
1. Are any devices in the environment running affected software versions? If yes, how many?
2. List the top 10 most critical affected devices (prioritise servers and devices handling sensitive data)
3. Is a patch or official mitigation available from the vendor?
4. Has this CVE been observed in active exploitation in the wild (check threat intelligence if available)?
5. Recommended immediate action: patch now, apply workaround, monitor, or no action

I need this within the next 30 minutes — prioritise speed over completeness. Flag anything I need to verify manually.
