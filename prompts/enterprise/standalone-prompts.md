# Copilot Enterprise Prompts (Standalone)

Prompts optimized for Microsoft Copilot Enterprise WITHOUT M365 integration. Designed for Copilot's conservative behavior: explicit instructions, structured outputs, and acknowledgment of limitations. Works with copilot.microsoft.com and Copilot in Edge.

> **Note:** These prompts account for key differences between Copilot and ChatGPT. Copilot has stricter safety filters, vision capabilities are more restricted, prefers "no result" over uncertain guesses, and is optimized for fast, safe, explainable answers.
