## What Are Scheduled Prompts?

Microsoft 365 Copilot lets you schedule any prompt to run automatically at a set day and time. The result saves to your Copilot conversation history. You can optionally receive a Teams or email notification when it finishes.

Scheduled prompts run against your Outlook email, calendar, and Teams data. They do not access SharePoint files, OneDrive documents, or Excel workbooks.

**Status:** Generally Available (GA) since January 2026  
**License required:** M365 Copilot paid add-on ($30/user/month) — not available on free Copilot Chat  
**Limit:** Up to 10 scheduled prompts per user

## Design Rules for Scheduled Prompts

These prompts are written for unattended execution. They follow four rules:

1. **Relative time windows** — "last 24 hours", "this week", "since Monday" — not "today's meeting" or "the email you sent me" which require context you won't provide at runtime.
2. **Self-contained output** — the result is useful without follow-up questions.
3. **Actionable format** — structured output (priority lists, tables, action items) not open-ended summaries.
4. **Scoped to available data** — Outlook email, calendar events, Teams messages only.

## Tips for Best Results

**Write for silence.** The prompt runs when you are not there. Every ambiguous reference (this, that, the current project) will produce a generic response. Be explicit about time windows and data scope.

**Start with one.** Set up the Monday morning brief first. Run it for two weeks before adding more. Adjust the prompt based on what it misses.

**10 is the limit.** Choose the prompts that replace the most manual effort. A daily email brief and a weekly pipeline review will save more time than five niche trackers.

**Check notification settings.** Set your top three to send a Teams notification. For lower-priority ones, let results accumulate in history and review them when you want to.
